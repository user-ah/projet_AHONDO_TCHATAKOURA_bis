@brief Compiles and executes a C++ program for haplotype inference.

@details
This script automates the compilation and execution of a C++ program (`infer_haplo.cpp`) that performs haplotype inference.
It first compiles the C++ source file using `g++ -std=c++17`, and upon successful compilation, executes the compiled program 
with the required input files: genotypes, ground truth haplotypes, inferred haplotypes, and a log file.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Compiles the C++ source file (`infer_haplo.cpp`).
2. Runs the compiled executable with the input genotype and haplotype files.
3. Generates an output file containing inferred haplotypes and a log file recording execution details.
4. Handles errors during compilation and execution, displaying appropriate error messages.

@section Features Key Features
- Compiles the C++ source code using `g++` with the C++17 standard.
- Executes the compiled program with input files: `genotypes.csv`, `haplotypes.csv`, and a specified log file.
- Handles compilation and execution errors, displaying meaningful error messages.
- Assumes that the C++ source code and necessary input files exist at the specified paths.

@section Preconditions Preconditions
- The C++ source file (`infer_haplo.cpp`) must be correctly written and located in `../src/infer_haplo/`.
- The input files (`genotypes.csv`, `haplotypes.csv`) must exist and be properly formatted.
- The output file for inferred haplotypes (`infered_haplo.csv`) and the log file (`log.txt`) must be correctly specified.
- The script must have execution permissions and necessary dependencies installed.

@section Output Output
- If successful, the script compiles and runs the C++ program, generating:
  - `infered_haplo.csv` (file with inferred haplotypes).
  - `log.txt` (execution log file).
- If an error occurs during compilation or execution, an appropriate error message is displayed.
