 * @brief Defines the function `save_csv` for saving a 2D vector of integers into a CSV file.
 * 
 * This header file contains the declaration of the `save_csv` function, which writes a 2D vector of integers
 * to a CSV file. The function ensures that values are separated by commas and rows are separated by newline characters.

 * 
 * @details
 * The `save_csv` function performs the following operations:
 * - Opens the specified file for writing.
 * - Iterates through each row of the 2D vector and writes the values to the file, adding commas between the values in a row.
 * - Adds a newline character after writing each row to separate rows.
 * - Closes the file after writing all the data.
 * 
 * @param filename The name of the file where the data will be saved.
 * @param data A 2D vector of integers containing the data to be written to the file.
