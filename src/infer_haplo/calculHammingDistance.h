 * 
 * @brief Computes the Hamming distance between two haplotypes.
 * 
 * @details
 * This header file declares the function `calculateHammingDistance`, which computes the 
 * Hamming distance between two haplotypes represented as vectors of integers. The Hamming 
 * distance is the number of positions where the corresponding elements of the two vectors differ.
 * 
 * The function ensures that both input haplotypes have the same length before performing the 
 * calculation. If they have different lengths, an exception is thrown.
 * 
 * @section Features Key Features
 * - Computes the Hamming distance between two haplotypes.
 * - Validates that both input vectors have the same size.
 * - Returns an integer representing the number of differing positions.
 * 
 * @section Preconditions Preconditions
 * - The two input haplotypes must have the same size (number of loci).
 * 
 * @param haplo1 The first haplotype, represented as a vector of integers.
 * @param haplo2 The second haplotype, represented as a vector of integers.
 * 
 * @throws std::invalid_argument If the two haplotypes have different sizes.
 * 
 * @return The Hamming distance (integer) between the two haplotypes.
 * 
 * @section Example Usage Example
 * @code
 * std::vector<int> haplo1 = {1, 0, 1, 1};
 * std::vector<int> haplo2 = {1, 1, 0, 1};
 * int distance = calculateHammingDistance(haplo1, haplo2);
 * std::cout << "Hamming Distance: " << distance << std::endl; // Output: Hamming Distance: 2
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @see calculateAverageHammingDistance()
