    Description:
    This header file defines a function to write log information to a specified log file. 
    The function records details such as the number of individuals, loci, EM iterations, execution time,
    and several statistics related to the genotypes and haplotypes.

    Key Features:
    - Records important information into a log file for analysis and debugging.
    - Provides details on the number of individuals, loci, and distinct haplotypes.
    - Records execution time and other relevant statistics.

    Output:
    - Writes the log data to a file, as specified by the `log_file` parameter.
    - Provides feedback on the success or failure of writing to the log file.

    Preconditions:
    - The `log_file` parameter must be a valid file path.
    - The `frequencies`, `genotypes`, and `haplotypes` data must be properly prepared before calling the function.
