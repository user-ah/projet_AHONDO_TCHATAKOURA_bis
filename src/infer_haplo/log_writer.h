 * @version 1.0
 * 
 * @brief Writes log information to a specified log file.
 * 
 * @details
 * This header file defines a function that writes log details to a specified file. The log contains 
 * information about the execution of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, including:
 * - The number of individuals and loci.
 * - The number of iterations and execution time.
 * - The number of distinct haplotypes found.
 * - Other relevant statistics for debugging and analysis.
 * 
 * @section Features Key Features
 * - Records key execution details into a log file.
 * - Logs information about the number of individuals, loci, and distinct haplotypes.
 * - Records execution time, EM iterations, and other relevant statistics.
 * - Provides feedback on the success or failure of writing to the log file.
 * 
 * @section Preconditions Preconditions
 * - The `log_file` parameter must be a valid file path and writable.
 * - The `frequencies`, `genotypes`, and `haplotypes` data must be properly initialized before calling the function.
 * 
 * @section Output Output
 * - Writes structured log data to a file specified by `log_file`.
 * - Provides success/failure feedback for log writing operations.

/**
 * @brief Writes execution details to a log file.
 * 
 * @details
 * This function records key execution details into a log file for debugging and analysis. 
 * It captures information such as:
 * - The number of individuals and loci.
 * - The number of EM iterations performed.
 * - Execution time in seconds.
 * - The number of distinct haplotypes identified.
 * - The computed average Hamming distance.
 * 
 * @param log_file The path to the log file where execution details will be written.
 * @param n_ind The number of individuals in the dataset.
 * @param n_loci The number of loci in the dataset.
 * @param nb_iterations The number of EM iterations performed.
 * @param execution_time The total execution time in seconds.
 * @param count_twos The number of occurrences of the allele `2` in the dataset.
 * @param n_distinct_ground_truth_haplotypes The number of distinct haplotypes in the ground truth data.
 * @param n_distinct_inferred_haplotypes The number of distinct haplotypes inferred by the algorithm.
 * @param average_distance The computed average Hamming distance.
 * 
 * @throws std::runtime_error If the log file cannot be opened or written to.
 * 
 * @return void
 * 
 * @section Example Example Usage
 * @code
 * writeLog("results/log.txt", 100, 50, 20, 1.23, 150, 30, 28, 0.05);
 * @endcode
